# My_Lidar_Alarm

A simulation of a robot running through a course. The robot it made to send a sensor out to ping for obstacles. Initially there was a single  ping directly in front of the robot. This was updated to ping a sweep in front of the robot to account for the robot width and for more than the obstacles directly in front. There is an alarm set on the robot to sound when an obstacle does appear. The reactive commander is used to turn the robot to avoid an on comming obstacle and turn
